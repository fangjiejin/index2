<h2>A bit about myself</h2>
<section class="topic1">
<div class="paragraph1">
	
	<p>I am an undergraduated IT students in RMIT and I come from China. The language I speak most is Chinese. My name is Fangjie Jin. It is a Chinese name. Fangjie is my given name and its get an interesting definition.</p>
	<ul2>
		<li>Fang means be a precise man</li>
		<li>Jie means be a successful man</li>
	</ul2>
	
	<p>In a word, my parents wants me to be a precise and successful man like Steve Jobs.<span class="rightarrow">&#8658;</span></p>
	<p>But actually I am emmmm..... how to say emmmm.... a 'good' boy.</p>
	<p>I have a part time job at Chinatown in city.I work as a waiter in a restaurant. The reason I find this job is the rental fee in city is pretty high. It costs nearly 90% of my living expenses and my life quality is highly influenced by that. I need some incomes to support my daily life.</p>

<h2>My interest in IT</h2>
<section class="topic2"	>
	<div class="paragraph2">
		<p>My interest in IT is game oprating. I like playing games and its part of my life. There are three games I played most in Australia which are Japan's Danmachi, China's Azur lane, and American's LOL(all shown below). It is a very incredible experience for me. These countries are far away from Australia, but I can still play their games without any limitations and lags. So I start thinking, what kind of technology allows the game has no region limit and How do they create such exciting visual experience?</p>
 		<p>It is a hard question for me. I only know something about HTML and some codes for java. My current knowledge is not enough to give out a solution. So I choose to enroll in the IT course of RMIT University. The IT course provides many exciting subjects, like the database(information store), networking(information transmit) and user-centered design(user experience) which are what I want.RMIT also has a well tutorial system which is helpful for students to review the knowledge learned from lectures. The tutors focus on training student practical skills which are suitable for me.  </p>
		<p>I hope after I complete the IT course in RMIT. I can understand how to create a game and give users excellent experiences.</p>

	<h2>Ideal job</h2>

	<p>My ideal job is to be a game developer. The reason is simple that game is a good funmaker. Players can gain happiness while playing games with friends. However, developing a game itself is very complicated. It is not as simple as coding an HTML page. The game developers have to be able to design the game structure, control the animations and music used while the game is running, and do some programming works. Programmers, designers, graphic artist, music artist and some other jobs are all parts of the game developer. </p>
	<p>My current skills are not enough to handle these jobs. I can not even create a good looking HTML page which is a bit disappointed for me.</p>

	<h2>How can I become a game developer?</h2>
	
	<section class="topic4">
	<div class="paragraph4">
	<ul class="list">
	<li>The first step is learning computer language such as java, HTML, and C++. These languages are the basement of creating a game.(The first step can be done in Uni study).</li> 
	<span class="arrowdown">&#8659;</span>	
	<li>The second step is learning to use game developing softwares such as Photoshop, 3D MAX, and DELPHI. These softwares help design the structure of a game. A good design may give the user an excellent interactive experience.(The second step can also be completed in uni study)</li>
		<span class="arrowdown">&#8659;</span>	
	<li>The third step is getting the user requirements. I need to find out what kind of game is accessible and the trend for the future. Then I can decide which direction I should go. Different design softwares give out different design styles. It is essential to use the correct software for creating a game. The third step can be done in working experience.</li>
		<span class="arrowdown">&#8659;</span>	
	<li>The fourth step is never stopping learning. The software and computer language are updated and renewed very fast in recent years. New softwares can bring a much more efficient working. It is not affordable for a company to employ a programmer who can only use the old software. So, I may choose to have a master degree after a period of work.
 	</li>
		<span class="arrowdown">&#8659;</span>	
	<li>
	The fifth step is simple. Creating a game and throwing it into the market. Get the respond from user, fixing the bug and improving the game.

	From the online test, I find out that I can be a friendly teammate. I like to hear others' ideas, and I am glad to give help to them. I am not the one to decide for the group, but I can find a direction for my team. I like to analysis others' ideas to find out the proper points and bad points. Then I can give some useful suggestions to my team leader. I don't mind to provide help to my teammates if they asked. I hope my teammates can be happy while at the meeting. A friendly atmosphere may help my brain to work. That's pretty much about myself in a team

	<h2>Project</h2>
	<section class="topic6">
	<div class="paragraph6">
	<p>The project I want to make is developing a smartphone app. In recent years the growth of the smartphone app has been immense and influential. There are many kinds of apps in the app market. This project aims to create an exciting and interesting mobile game app for game players. The developing tools Unity is used in the process of creating. The game should have a new play style.</p>
	<p>Nowadays, smartphones are prevalent in human's life. The table below shows that it is about 84% of Australians are using the smartphone in 2018. It is a massive number of people, and there is a big market are waiting for digging. A popular game app can attract a lot of users, such as the game Clash of Clans and pokemon go. A preference shows that the Clash of Clans earns about 2.4million dollars per day. It is a crazy amount of money. Therefore, creating a game app has significant potential. The challenge is how to make the game accessible.</p>
	<p>Before creating the object, I have to understand the users' needs. According to the game ranking published in Google shop, the action, shoot, strategy, and collection games are favorite these years. It gives me a direction that I can create a game that contains strategy and collection attributes.</p> 
	<p>The strategy game is different from the action game, and it requires more brain works. That's a point. Nowadays, more and more people are educated. Most of the users don't mind to try some strategy games to show how smart they are â€” for example, the game 2048 and plants vs. zombies. So I want to create a game that contains the chess elements. The game has at least six occupations such as rook, bishop, knight, pawn, King, and Queen. The player has a wide range to pick characters. The different profession has a particular usage. The player has to combine five characters into one team to complete tasks. </p>
    <p>The collection element makes the game's life longer. If a player can not feel freshness from a game, it means he will leave soon. Publishing some new characters in each new version is an efficient way to keep players' freshness.  The method I want to use is to create a time locker, and the players can unlock the new characters and some functions by adding up the game time. </p>
    <p>There is another thing the user cares more. It is the price of purchase items. Most of the players don't like to pay too much on a game. So the items sold in a game shop cannot influence the properties of the characters. Or people may feel unfair to against a "rich man".</p>
	<p>The tools used to build the project is Unity. Unity is the ultimate game development platform. It can create high-quality 3D games that are suitable for the current market. The user likes to have an excellent visual experience. There is a programing language called C++. It is also essential for creating a game. It controls the interaction between the user and the game. </p>
    <p>If the project is successful, it can bring a lot of worth to me. I may also receive some responding from the users. I will decide to change some parts of the game depending on the percentage of responding from the user. After developing, the games can attract more players come. I can gain more money. It will form a good cycle.</p>
